<h1>Challenger Alura Latam -by: Juan Manoel</h1>
<h1>What it is about?</h1>
<p>In this chalenger I have to make an foro. What is foro? Foro is a place on internet where you can make questions and receve feedback from others peaple. Like stackoverflow</p>
<h1>How did I do?</h1>
<p>Using Spring boot, PostgretSQL, Insomia and all my knowledge about this techinologs (which Alura Latan and Oracle Next Education provaded to me) I could make it possible</p>
<h1>About my project</h1>
<h2>how I organized it?</h2>
<p>I organized it by functionality. So if you want to see models, you must open <a href="https://github.com/JuManoel/chalenger-foro-alura/tree/main/src/main/java/edu/alura/chalenger_foro/models">the folder models</a></p>
<p>I used this method becouse I easier to explore and find Errors, and is easier to organize I find any file</p>
<h2>What was the most difficult part?</h2>
<p>For me was understand about the class model</p>

<p>As you can see, perfil looks like useless. But thanks to may classmates, they make me to see that perfil is like roles, like admin, user and etc...</p>
<h2>My best part for me</h2>
<p>In this project I have the idea to develop all that I need and after that start to find bugs. I spend 2 days only coding and other day to finding and fixing bug. I felt this made me code faster, and allows me to be able to upload it before the deadline</p>
<h1>What did I learn?</h1>
<ol>
  <li>More about token and the Roles like ADMIN, USER and how they work</li>
  <li>Good practices to make projects</li>
  <li>Reforce my knowledge about SpringBoot tags (the stuff with @)</li>
  <li>Data Base connection</li>
  <li>How a server works</li>
</ol>
